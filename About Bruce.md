## What keeps me up at night?
- Climate change and the high probability that my children won't live as long as me
- The state of democacy around the world

## What were the first lines of code that I ever wrote?
It was a long time ago on a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) in a language call [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).
```BASIC
100 FOR X = 1 TO 100
101 PRINT "My name is Bruce!!!"
102 NEXT X
103 END
```
It was so cool to make the computer do stuff just by writing some text.

## What would I do if I had a million dollars?
1. Donate a bunch to Sick Kids Hospital
1. Buy a really nice E-ink tablet
1. Buy a subscription to Uber or Lyft for unlimited rides so I wouldn't have to drive anymore
