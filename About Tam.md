## What were the first lines of code that I ever wrote?
My first piece of code was a while ago, so I hardly remember what it was that I made, But I know for sure that it was on Java. System.out.println, or something similar to that. 

I didn't really enjoy coding at first, but learning more about how code works made it much more fun. There's a lot that I still don't know, but I'm excited to learn. 

## What would I do if I had a million dollars?
1. Donate to a charity or two, most likely ones relating to mental health and child illness. 
1. Pamper my loved ones 
1. More money = more freetime
