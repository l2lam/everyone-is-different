# Raccoons 
## An arguement
The occasional person have a low opinion of raccoons. This is in fact, wrong. Anyone who thinks raccoons are bad is a complete idiot. 

fact

## What keeps me up at night?
- The fact that most raccoons don't live to their natural lifespan, dying early in the streets
- Whether or not raccoons will survive the coming impacts of climate change

## What were the first lines of code that I ever wrote?
Sadly, they were not about raccoons. At the time (in 2014), I was not aware of the marvelous glory of raccoons. I was coding in a program called [Codecombat] (https://codecombat.com/), where the first code I wrote was:
```Basic
hero.moveRight()
hero.moveDown()
hero.moveRight()
```

## What would I do if I had a million dollars?
